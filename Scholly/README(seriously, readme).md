## Why
The only problem I got into is Midsommar, the deadline was too much for what I planned. 

For the case of delimiting the size of groups, I would save the minimum and maximum size of the groups in the groups object. 
At some point, the group service would give the functionality of picking students by subjects and fitting them into groups. This could be possible quering the tables between students, their classes groups == their subjects groups. 
However, It is late and I have to work tomorrow, so it will be let in the backlog and worked up in the next spring ;)
